== Introduction

The oVirt Java SDK is a Java package that simplifies access to the
oVirt Engine API.

== Building

Most of the source code of the Java SDK is automatically generated
from the API model.

The code generator is a Java program that resides in the `generator`
directory. This Java program will get the API model and the metamodel
artifacts from the available Maven repositories. To build and run it use
the following commands:

  $ git clone git://gerrit.ovirt.org/ovirt-engine-sdk-java
  $ mvn package

This will build the code generator and run it to generate the SDK for
the version of the API that corresponds to the branch of the SDK that
you are using.

If you need to generate it for a different version of the API then you
can use the `model.version` property. For example, if you need to
generate the SDK for version `4.1.0` of the SDK you can use this
command:

  $ mvn package -Dmodel.version=4.1.0

Once the source code is generated, it needs to be built:

  $ cd sdk
  $ mvn clean install

The generated `.jar` files will be located in the `sdk/target`
directory:

  $ find target -name '*.jar'
  target/ovirt-engine-sdk-4.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
